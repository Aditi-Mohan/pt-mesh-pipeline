Output 1 will support the National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL) in building about 1,000 rental units, three integrated community service centers, and two recycled waste stations connected to services, in support of the Sustainable Development Goal 1. The government selected high-priority investments as subprojects. The increase in the supply of affordable rental housing is expected to immediately relieve the housing shortage and benefit lower-income civil servants (about 10%) and non-civil servants (about 90%), including marginalized municipal waste workers. The building designs incorporate gender-inclusive features; enhanced safety against earthquake and fire hazards; and resource efficiency, making greater use of locally available materials. The building structures will employ reinforced-concrete frames and innovative pre-engineered structures. The project design has identified and incorporated climate and disaster resilience features, considering multiple hazards. The project will support green building certification through the International Finance Corporation's Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE). The housing designs reflect local cultural heritage values and traditional architecture. Additional subprojects will be selected during project implementation in line with the National Housing Policy, 2020 (NHP) using the eligibility criteria set out in the project administration manual.Output 2: Institutional capacities, policy, and regulatory framework of the housing sector strengthened. This output will (i) strengthen the NHDCL's housing design, construction, and management capacity; (ii) review the building code and regulations; (iii) develop climate- and disaster-resilient building designs and related solutions to improve safety, resource efficiency, and gender and disability inclusiveness; (iv) conduct awareness training and a capacity building program for key project stakeholders on climate- and disaster-resilient design and the building code; (v) enhance the NHDCL's business model, strengthening its operation and maintenance capacity, and developing partnerships with the private sector; (vi) strengthen the housing management information system of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement by expanding it to include tenancy data; (vii) develop a gender and socially inclusive national homeownership strategy, including a rent-to-own mechanism; and (viii) provide project implementation support, including supervision, and set up a safeguard unit in the NHDCL.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 31000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54355-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-pam", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-gap", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-tar", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-pp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rp-2", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rf-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-sddr-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rp-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-6", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-7", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-8", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-earf-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-4", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-5", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rf", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rp-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-2", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-sddr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee-3", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-earf", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-iee", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54355-001-rp"], "sectors": ["Water and other urban infrastructure and services"], "subsectors": ["Urban housing"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-12-08 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2021-06-29 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2021-07-09 00:00:00", "mrm": "2021-09-23 00:00:00", "approval": "2021-12-07 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-12-07 00:00:00"}},

{"original_id": "55262-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Supporting Health Systems Strengthening Projects", "description": "India is one of the fast-growing large economies and its growth averaged over 6.7% between 2015 and 2019. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic hit the Indian economy hard. The economy faced its worse ever contraction in fiscal year (FY) 2020 since World War II, contracting at 7.3% in FY2020. Economic activity will continue to remain below the pre-pandemic level despite a strong rebound of 10.0% in FY2021 and 7.5% in FY2022. The government has significantly widened the fiscal deficit to fight the pandemic and support economic and social recovery. Fiscal deficit was revised up to 9.5% (FY2020-2021) amid falling revenue and increased expenditure, from budgeted 4.6% of gross domestic product made last year (FY2019-2020). India has reported over 32.4 million confirmed cases, second largest after the United States as of 22 August 2021. India faced a devastating second wave starting March 2021 and was reporting more the 400,000 COVID-19 positive cases daily for 4 consecutive days and peaked on 7 May 2021 with a record high of 414,188 new COVID-19 cases. Despite the containment measures and increased testing capacity (over 2.2 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, COVID-19 threat of impending third wave looms high. Its negative mental and physical health impacts, especially on vulnerable population groups such as urban migrant population and old persons, will require longer-term health system responses.ADB has been a key partner in supporting pandemic response and health system strengthening efforts. ADB's country partnership strategy, 2018-2022 supports expansion of public health service delivery in urban areas with a focus on the poor and vulnerable. In December 2020, the ADB Board approved a $300 million loan to strengthen and improve access to comprehensive primary health care in urban areas in India under PM-ASBY. In addition to the loan, a $2 million technical assistance (TA) grant from ADB's Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will support for program implementation and coordination, capacity building, and innovation. This support builds on ADB's previous support to urban health system strengthening under NHM amounting to $300 million. ADB was a key partner in supporting COVID-19 response efforts through a COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option with a loan of $1.5 billion. ADB also extended a $3 million grant to support strengthening of points of entry and enhance disease surveillance under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. In July 2021, ADB approved a TA to strengthen availability of oxygen supplies and vaccine deployment amount to $7 million, primarily in response to the second wave. ADB is in ongoing discussions with the government to support vaccine procurement efforts under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility with a support of $1.5 billion. The government has appreciated the design and implementation of ADB's prior TA, which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. ADB support can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected states. Second, ADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs to enhance multisectoral engagement, in line with the vision laid out in ADB strategy 2030 and in complete alignment with government COVID-19 response which adopts the whole of government approach to strengthen response. ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 2000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/55262-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ind-55262-001-tar"], "sectors": ["Health"], "subsectors": ["Disease control of communicable disease-Health system development"], "country_name": "India", "timestamps": {"approval": "2021-10-02 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-10-02 00:00:00"}},

However, tourism was one of the hardest hit industries during this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, GDP growth is estimated to contract 3.4% in 2021, and the youth unemployment rate almost doubled in 2020 (22.6%) from 2019 (11.9%), a record high for the country. Youth unemployment is more challenging for women (25.4%) and urban areas (33.3%) in 2020, and 19.0% of unemployed youth reported that they were laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The skills shortages are a critical constraint on private sector development in Bhutan. An estimated 110,000 Bhutanese will enter the labor market from 2016 to 2026 and equipping these youth with emerging skills is a supply side challenge. With a relatively high job placement rate of 76% for TVET graduates during 2003-2018, TVET has a role to play. Labor market demand has been weak during the pandemic, but some industries such as construction need national skilled workers urgently because foreign skilled workers returned to their home countries. TVET graduates are much needed, not only for addressing COVID-19 impacts now but also for developing a critical mass of technicians and professionals for the future. However, TVET faces challenges on limited enrollment and instructor capacities. Pathways are also restricted and social stigma attached to TVET did not motivate youth to take up skills development courses. The stereotypes and social norms on the types of jobs women should do also produced imbalance on course selection and enrollment for women.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 500000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54464-002/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/bhu-54464-002-tar"], "sectors": ["Education"], "subsectors": ["Technical and vocational education and training"], "country_name": "Bhutan", "timestamps": {"approval": "2021-09-21 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-09-21 00:00:00"}},

The current Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) is also in poor condition and does not fully meet the requirements even for the existing runway.The project will be aligned with the following impact: national productivity improved by ensuring better connectivity of its people within and outside of the country.

The project will have the following outcome: social and economic status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved. Output 1: Transport infrastructure improved. The project will upgrade seven district and commune roads totaling about 121.8 km, which will improve connectivity and mobility of EMCs within seven districts with a total population of 206,700 of which an average of 48% belong to EMCs. The climate-resilient transport links will integrate remote rural production into market chains and processing facilities. Freight movement of acacia and high value crops will be improved. The effort of EMCs to dependably reach essential services including health, education, and markets will be reduced. The overall transport network will be much more efficient, reducing travel time for road users and especially improving access to health, education, and market services especially for women who already suffer from time poverty.Output 2: Water resource infrastructure improved.

{"original_id": "54212-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Building-Coastal Resilience through Nature-Based and Integrated Solutions", "description": "Building coastal resilience in Asia-Pacific is an urgent priority. It requires adopting long-term and integrated planning approaches that favor adaptive management, a risk-based approach, inclusive processes, and consider the full spectrum of coastal resilience options. Given their potential benefits, nature-based solutions should be considered as part of integrated plans combining _grey_ and _green_ solutions and _soft_ measures such as awareness raising, policy making, land use planning and early warning. The TA will support DMCs based on demand and potential impact and will explore linkages with other ADB programs. Consideration will also be given to potential for knowledge-sharing and scaling-up of TA activities across the region. Output 1: Strategic plans, policies and programs to build coastal resilience prepared. Output 1 will support the (i) development of long-term integrated plans for building coastal resilience through integrated and sustainable solutions, such as coastline management plans or adaptation plans following a _pathway approach_, strengthening multi-level governance arrangements, following participative processes when possible, prioritizing plans with regional benefits, and integrating with larger strategies for maximum impact; (ii) identification of necessary policies and investments to enhance coastal resilience and sustainably manage coastal ecosystems, including the development of sustainable coastal livelihood and economic development programs, with special attention to vulnerable groups and women's empowerment.Output 2: Nature-based and integrated coastal resilience investments supported. The TA will provide specialist support, based on demand from operations departments and DMCs, to identify, prepare and accelerate interventions to boost coastal resilience, prioritizing activities that achieve multiple resilience benefits and those with regional benefits, and promoting multi-functional design and long-term sustainability. The scope of specialists' inputs will focus on (i) nature-based, soft and hybrid solutions; and (ii) economic development opportunities and livelihoods for coastal communities. Such inputs could include (i) assessments to inform ADB's country partnership strategy and country operation business plans; (ii) supporting the preparation of concept papers; and (iii) providing inputs to improve project design and implementation.Output 3: Knowledge, regional cooperation, and financing for building coastal resilience improved. The TA will develop knowledge products to advance coastal resilience solutions know-how, the use of nature-based approaches, and the role and value of coastal ecosystems including its economic dimension and maintenance. The TA will encourage regional cooperation on coastal and marine ecosystems as regional public goods. For this purpose, the TA will work with regional programs, and specifically with the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia -Malaysia-Philippines East Association of Southeast Asian Nations Growth Area, and other cooperative platforms such as the South Asia Cooperative Environment Program and the Atoll Dialogue, to strengthen regional knowledge sharing, replicate successful approaches and foster the dialogue among participating DMCs on how to scale up successful initiatives to regional levels, encouraging a more regional approach to dealing with coastal ecosystems. Cross-country study visits, regional knowledge-sharing workshops and dialogue events will be organized for this purpose in collaboration with regional cooperation programs. The TA will also support the development of innovative ocean financing mechanisms (e.g. a coral reef insurance initiative) and the mobilization of additional funding.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 1994000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54212-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/reg-54212-001-tar"], "sectors": ["Agriculture, natural resources and rural development", "Water and other urban infrastructure and services"], "subsectors": ["Water-based natural resources management", "Urban flood protection"], "country_name": "Regional", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-06-30 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-04-13 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-04-13 00:00:00", "approval": "2021-06-30 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-07-02 00:00:00"}},

The TA's impact will be that the private sector is transformed into a driver of economic growth. The outcome will be Viet Nam's private sector in terms of quantity, quality, efficiency and sustainability developed.2. The TA will achieve this outcome through three outputs. First, it will focus on project development. This is particularly important for PPPs where the government is preparing the Medium-Term Investment Plan (MTIP) 2021-5. Projects in the MTIP will have already completed prefeasibility assessments, but the TA will help to screen for the most promising of these PPP and prepare at least one feasibility study. Contingent on the availability of additional funding, the TA is also expected to play a role in upstream transaction development in the sectors where ADB's non-sovereign operations are strategically focused.3. Second, the TA will provide gender-sensitive policy advice. Infrastructure is a significant governmental priority, but there is little research as how this infrastructure should be developed to meet the needs of women. The TA would fund a study to examine this question with the study expected to inform the operations of the government and development partners as they conceptualize solutions to Viet Nam's infrastructure needs. Policy advice will also extend to the implementation of the PPP law. Although the government is expected to have published most of the corresponding decrees and circulars before TA implementation, the Ministry of Planning and Investment is going to have ongoing needs for policy advice to adjust these documents as the first PPPs are implemented.4. Finally, it will support the capacity development of both the government and the private sector. One focus will be on helping women to emerge in infrastructure and related technical fields through sponsoring a leadership program for promising managers and an internship program to encourage more young women to enter these fields. Another focus will be on provincial leadership. Viet Nam's expertise in PPPs is clustered in the central government. For PPPs to become viable at lower levels, capacity building is a precursor. The TA will select two provinces and/or municipalities to improve their (i) technical and managerial capacity for prioritizing, screening and early-stage development of municipal PPPs, and (ii) financial capacity to implement them.5. A TA is merited over a grant-financed project because a TA (i) aligns with the Government of Canada's priorities on how the funding should be used and (ii) creates more opportunities to leverage ADB's considerable expertise in these areas.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 4600000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54445-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-54445-001-tar", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-54445-001-cp"], "sectors": ["Finance", "Industry and trade", "Public sector management"], "subsectors": ["Money and capital markets", "Small and medium enterprise development", "Public administration"], "country_name": "Viet Nam", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-11-13 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-11-12 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-11-12 00:00:00", "approval": "2021-06-10 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-06-16 00:00:00"}},

{"original_id": "53060-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Shaanxi Xi’an Preschool Education Development Program", "description": "As the People's Republic of China (PRC) transitions from a middle-income, manufacturing-based economy to a high-income innovation economy, investing in the human capital of its future labor force is key. As the first step in lifelong learning, investment in early childhood education (ECE) pays off for society, delivering significant social and economic benefits that include increased labor productivity and reduced inequality. Evidence confirms that participation in ECE is associated with additional years of schooling, a key indicator of human capital, and results from the PRC were higher than the pooled average of 12 countries. The government has made significant efforts to ramp up support at this important level. Under a series of national ECE action plans, the PRC's gross enrollment ratio (GER) for 3-year ECE increased by 23 percentage points from 56.6% in 2010 to 79.6% in 2017, but the country has yet to attain the near-universal enrollment (over 90%) achieved in neighboring countries Japan and the Republic of Korea, and in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The government recognizes that promoting equitable access to high quality ECE is an effective strategy for inclusive development, and has set ambitious national targets that include, by 2020, a GER of 85% for 3-year ECE for children aged 3 6 years, and a coverage rate of \"public-interest kindergartens\" comprising public kindergartens plus affordable privately-owned kindergartens of at least 80% of enrolled children.Located in Shaanxi province, the rapidly growing city of Xi'an is facing a major shortage of affordable kindergarten places, which threatens to widen existing gaps in access and perpetuate inequality. Comprising 11 districts and two counties, Xi'an's increasing population is a result of both the 2016 two-child policy and the 2017 relaxation of household registration policies for migrants. The number of permanent residents grew from 8.8 million in 2016 to more than 10 million by the end of 2018, and is projected to exceed 11.4 million by 2025. Increasing privatization of ECE has led to a proliferation of private kindergartens that charge high fees, which creates cost barriers for low-income families. About 70,000 children attend informal child care centers with uneven quality. With several gaps in the provision of affordable high quality ECE, the Xi'an Municipal Government (XMG) has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for a results-based lending (RBL) program based on the comprehensive Xi'an Preschool Education Development Plan, 2019 -2025. Xi'an has made notable progress in developing ECE especially over the past decade, including through a series of three 3-year ECE plans, a plan for quality improvement, and guidelines for managing privately-owned public-interest kindergartens. However, several critical challenges remain. The 2019 -2025 plan contains a sector analysis that diagnoses the key constraints, including (i) insufficient kindergarten seats to meet current and projected demand; (ii) a geographically imbalanced distribution of high quality public-interest kindergartens; (iii) a shortage of qualified ECE teachers and insufficient in-service training opportunities; and (iv) a need for better financing and cost-sharing mechanisms, regulation, and supervision of ECE, particularly for private kindergartens. A lack of innovation in the curriculum and in the delivery of ECE also affects kindergarten quality. The plan notes that in 2018, a total of 75% of Xi'an's 1,780 registered kindergartens were considered public-interest (36% were public). The Xi'an Education Bureau (XEB) assesses 38% of the existing kindergartens as class IV or V, meaning they do not meet the standards to be considered high quality (either class I, II, or III or designated as a Shaanxi provincial demonstration kindergarten). To address these challenges, the 2019 -2025 plan's intended results include accelerating development of ECE to benefit all while elevating quality and promoting balance.Gender issues in ECE. The XEB forecasts a shortage of more than 118,000 kindergarten seats by 2025. Children's lack of access to kindergarten has an impact on both children's future learning outcomes and labor market productivity and on their mothers' ability to engage in the formal and informal labor force. A lack of sufficient kindergarten spaces increases women's unpaid care work and time poverty. The proposed RBL program aims at effective gender mainstreaming and will explore these and other gender issues in ECE during program preparation, including (i) boys' and girls' equal access to enrollment, (ii) gender-responsive and inclusive ECE curriculum, (iii) the low representation of men among preschool teachers, (iv) the involvement of fathers in parenting education, and (v) the issue of migrant workers' left-behind children, who are more likely to be girls.Lessons from ADB country and sector engagement. ADB's education sector partnership with the PRC has evolved from smaller investment lending for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) to larger RBL operations in both TVET and ECE. For example, an ongoing TVET project in Nanning, Guangxi is responding to the shortage of ECE teachers. A first ADB ECE lending operation is being developed in Shangrao, Jiangxi province and can provide lessons for the proposed program in Xi'an. Ongoing TVET RBL programs in Guizhou and Guangxi have confirmed the modality's suitability for sector programs that involve many stakeholders. Experience has also shown that RBL is particularly appropriate for large-scale systematic teacher training. Lessons include the need for (i) stakeholders to understand the nature of the program including deliverables for meeting the agreed targets and disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), (ii) robust financial planning by the executing agency because disbursement is made based on achievement of DLIs, (iii) a strong monitoring mechanism, and (iv) close communication between ADB and the executing agency on progress monitoring towards DLI achievement.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 150000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/53060-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-pra-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-rrp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-pssa"], "sectors": ["Education"], "subsectors": ["Pre-primary and primary-Pre-primary and primary - social protection initiatives"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-01-22 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-09-14 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-09-18 00:00:00", "mrm": "2020-11-27 00:00:00", "approval": "2021-06-04 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-06-04 00:00:00"}},
