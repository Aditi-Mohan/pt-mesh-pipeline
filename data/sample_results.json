The regional technical assistance (TA) program will support research and development to achieve a greater understanding of the commercialization and bankability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), across key markets in the Central and West Asia (CWA) region; and enhance SOEs' institutional capacity to access commercial financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and cofinanciers. The TA will focus on positioning ADB as a partner in driving forward the financial sustainability and commercialization of strategic SOEs, and in doing so enable more SOE-related commercially oriented investment opportunities in the region. This approach will pilot new approaches such as credit mapping and innovative SOE 360 reviews, as well as build the tools, techniques, and teams to establish and implement comprehensive individual SOE transformation programs to support new and deeper engagements with SOEs. 2. The TA is aligned with ADB's Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of strengthening governance and institutional capacity. It will promote greater commercial orientation of SOEs and help improve their access to financing on commercial terms and conditions by improving their governance and institutional capacity for service delivery through SOE reforms. The TA also responds directly to Strategy 2030's target of expanding private sector operations, including preparing SOEs for accessing commercial financing under the One ADB approach, bringing together knowledge and expertise for the benefit of ADB's clients. In line with another operational priority of Strategy 2030 accelerating progress in gender equality the TA incorporates some gender elements in the analysis and program design so that SOEs will contribute to the advancement of gender equality.3.

However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic hit the Indian economy hard. The economy faced its worse ever contraction in fiscal year (FY) 2020 since World War II, contracting at 7.3% in FY2020. Economic activity will continue to remain below the pre-pandemic level despite a strong rebound of 10.0% in FY2021 and 7.5% in FY2022. The government has significantly widened the fiscal deficit to fight the pandemic and support economic and social recovery. Fiscal deficit was revised up to 9.5% (FY2020-2021) amid falling revenue and increased expenditure, from budgeted 4.6% of gross domestic product made last year (FY2019-2020). India has reported over 32.4 million confirmed cases, second largest after the United States as of 22 August 2021. India faced a devastating second wave starting March 2021 and was reporting more the 400,000 COVID-19 positive cases daily for 4 consecutive days and peaked on 7 May 2021 with a record high of 414,188 new COVID-19 cases. Despite the containment measures and increased testing capacity (over 2.2 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, COVID-19 threat of impending third wave looms high. Its negative mental and physical health impacts, especially on vulnerable population groups such as urban migrant population and old persons, will require longer-term health system responses.ADB has been a key partner in supporting pandemic response and health system strengthening efforts. ADB's country partnership strategy, 2018-2022 supports expansion of public health service delivery in urban areas with a focus on the poor and vulnerable. In December 2020, the ADB Board approved a $300 million loan to strengthen and improve access to comprehensive primary health care in urban areas in India under PM-ASBY. In addition to the loan, a $2 million technical assistance (TA) grant from ADB's Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will support for program implementation and coordination, capacity building, and innovation. This support builds on ADB's previous support to urban health system strengthening under NHM amounting to $300 million. ADB was a key partner in supporting COVID-19 response efforts through a COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option with a loan of $1.5 billion. ADB also extended a $3 million grant to support strengthening of points of entry and enhance disease surveillance under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. In July 2021, ADB approved a TA to strengthen availability of oxygen supplies and vaccine deployment amount to $7 million, primarily in response to the second wave. ADB is in ongoing discussions with the government to support vaccine procurement efforts under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility with a support of $1.5 billion. The government has appreciated the design and implementation of ADB's prior TA, which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. ADB support can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected states. Second, ADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs to enhance multisectoral engagement, in line with the vision laid out in ADB strategy 2030 and in complete alignment with government COVID-19 response which adopts the whole of government approach to strengthen response. ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 2000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/55262-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ind-55262-001-tar"], "sectors": ["Health"], "subsectors": ["Disease control of communicable disease-Health system development"], "country_name": "India", "timestamps": {"approval": "2021-10-02 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-10-02 00:00:00"}},

However, tourism was one of the hardest hit industries during this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, GDP growth is estimated to contract 3.4% in 2021, and the youth unemployment rate almost doubled in 2020 (22.6%) from 2019 (11.9%), a record high for the country. Youth unemployment is more challenging for women (25.4%) and urban areas (33.3%) in 2020, and 19.0% of unemployed youth reported that they were laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The skills shortages are a critical constraint on private sector development in Bhutan. An estimated 110,000 Bhutanese will enter the labor market from 2016 to 2026 and equipping these youth with emerging skills is a supply side challenge. With a relatively high job placement rate of 76% for TVET graduates during 2003-2018, TVET has a role to play. Labor market demand has been weak during the pandemic, but some industries such as construction need national skilled workers urgently because foreign skilled workers returned to their home countries. TVET graduates are much needed, not only for addressing COVID-19 impacts now but also for developing a critical mass of technicians and professionals for the future. However, TVET faces challenges on limited enrollment and instructor capacities. Pathways are also restricted and social stigma attached to TVET did not motivate youth to take up skills development courses.

The project will have the following outcome: social and economic status and inclusiveness of ethnic minorities communities improved. Output 1: Transport infrastructure improved. The project will upgrade seven district and commune roads totaling about 121.8 km, which will improve connectivity and mobility of EMCs within seven districts with a total population of 206,700 of which an average of 48% belong to EMCs. The climate-resilient transport links will integrate remote rural production into market chains and processing facilities. Freight movement of acacia and high value crops will be improved. The effort of EMCs to dependably reach essential services including health, education, and markets will be reduced. The overall transport network will be much more efficient, reducing travel time for road users and especially improving access to health, education, and market services especially for women who already suffer from time poverty.Output 2: Water resource infrastructure improved. This output will benefit about 36,300 people through the construction, upgrade, rehabilitation, or stabilization of: (i) RDWSs to provide water to approximately 18,600 people through 115 km of piped networks; (ii) an existing reservoir to support 117 ha of irrigation command area with more reliable and efficient water supply; and (iii) cultural tourism infrastructure including one river defense - 3.6 km of embankment, visitor car parking and solid waste collection in district's communities with a total population of 17,700 of which 94% are from EMCs. Activities under this output will improve communities' health by reducing the risk of water borne diseases and will particularly benefit women by reducing their time for water collection.Output 3: Data systems for climate risk management updated. This output will provide improved access to reliable weather and climate data, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to user agencies to inform a wide range of decisions including design of climate resilient infrastructure, strengthened early warning systems, and improved disaster response.

{"original_id": "53060-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Shaanxi Xi’an Preschool Education Development Program", "description": "As the People's Republic of China (PRC) transitions from a middle-income, manufacturing-based economy to a high-income innovation economy, investing in the human capital of its future labor force is key. As the first step in lifelong learning, investment in early childhood education (ECE) pays off for society, delivering significant social and economic benefits that include increased labor productivity and reduced inequality. Evidence confirms that participation in ECE is associated with additional years of schooling, a key indicator of human capital, and results from the PRC were higher than the pooled average of 12 countries. The government has made significant efforts to ramp up support at this important level. Under a series of national ECE action plans, the PRC's gross enrollment ratio (GER) for 3-year ECE increased by 23 percentage points from 56.6% in 2010 to 79.6% in 2017, but the country has yet to attain the near-universal enrollment (over 90%) achieved in neighboring countries Japan and the Republic of Korea, and in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The government recognizes that promoting equitable access to high quality ECE is an effective strategy for inclusive development, and has set ambitious national targets that include, by 2020, a GER of 85% for 3-year ECE for children aged 3 6 years, and a coverage rate of \"public-interest kindergartens\" comprising public kindergartens plus affordable privately-owned kindergartens of at least 80% of enrolled children.Located in Shaanxi province, the rapidly growing city of Xi'an is facing a major shortage of affordable kindergarten places, which threatens to widen existing gaps in access and perpetuate inequality. Comprising 11 districts and two counties, Xi'an's increasing population is a result of both the 2016 two-child policy and the 2017 relaxation of household registration policies for migrants. The number of permanent residents grew from 8.8 million in 2016 to more than 10 million by the end of 2018, and is projected to exceed 11.4 million by 2025. Increasing privatization of ECE has led to a proliferation of private kindergartens that charge high fees, which creates cost barriers for low-income families. About 70,000 children attend informal child care centers with uneven quality. With several gaps in the provision of affordable high quality ECE, the Xi'an Municipal Government (XMG) has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for a results-based lending (RBL) program based on the comprehensive Xi'an Preschool Education Development Plan, 2019 -2025. Xi'an has made notable progress in developing ECE especially over the past decade, including through a series of three 3-year ECE plans, a plan for quality improvement, and guidelines for managing privately-owned public-interest kindergartens. However, several critical challenges remain. The 2019 -2025 plan contains a sector analysis that diagnoses the key constraints, including (i) insufficient kindergarten seats to meet current and projected demand; (ii) a geographically imbalanced distribution of high quality public-interest kindergartens; (iii) a shortage of qualified ECE teachers and insufficient in-service training opportunities; and (iv) a need for better financing and cost-sharing mechanisms, regulation, and supervision of ECE, particularly for private kindergartens. A lack of innovation in the curriculum and in the delivery of ECE also affects kindergarten quality. The plan notes that in 2018, a total of 75% of Xi'an's 1,780 registered kindergartens were considered public-interest (36% were public). The Xi'an Education Bureau (XEB) assesses 38% of the existing kindergartens as class IV or V, meaning they do not meet the standards to be considered high quality (either class I, II, or III or designated as a Shaanxi provincial demonstration kindergarten). To address these challenges, the 2019 -2025 plan's intended results include accelerating development of ECE to benefit all while elevating quality and promoting balance.Gender issues in ECE. The XEB forecasts a shortage of more than 118,000 kindergarten seats by 2025. Children's lack of access to kindergarten has an impact on both children's future learning outcomes and labor market productivity and on their mothers' ability to engage in the formal and informal labor force. A lack of sufficient kindergarten spaces increases women's unpaid care work and time poverty. The proposed RBL program aims at effective gender mainstreaming and will explore these and other gender issues in ECE during program preparation, including (i) boys' and girls' equal access to enrollment, (ii) gender-responsive and inclusive ECE curriculum, (iii) the low representation of men among preschool teachers, (iv) the involvement of fathers in parenting education, and (v) the issue of migrant workers' left-behind children, who are more likely to be girls.Lessons from ADB country and sector engagement. ADB's education sector partnership with the PRC has evolved from smaller investment lending for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) to larger RBL operations in both TVET and ECE. For example, an ongoing TVET project in Nanning, Guangxi is responding to the shortage of ECE teachers. A first ADB ECE lending operation is being developed in Shangrao, Jiangxi province and can provide lessons for the proposed program in Xi'an. Ongoing TVET RBL programs in Guizhou and Guangxi have confirmed the modality's suitability for sector programs that involve many stakeholders. Experience has also shown that RBL is particularly appropriate for large-scale systematic teacher training. Lessons include the need for (i) stakeholders to understand the nature of the program including deliverables for meeting the agreed targets and disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), (ii) robust financial planning by the executing agency because disbursement is made based on achievement of DLIs, (iii) a strong monitoring mechanism, and (iv) close communication between ADB and the executing agency on progress monitoring towards DLI achievement.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Approved", "budget": 150000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/53060-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-pra-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-rrp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53060-001-pssa"], "sectors": ["Education"], "subsectors": ["Pre-primary and primary-Pre-primary and primary - social protection initiatives"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-01-22 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-09-14 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-09-18 00:00:00", "mrm": "2020-11-27 00:00:00", "approval": "2021-06-04 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-06-04 00:00:00"}},

The TA's impact will be that the private sector is transformed into a driver of economic growth. The outcome will be Viet Nam's private sector in terms of quantity, quality, efficiency and sustainability developed.2. The TA will achieve this outcome through three outputs. First, it will focus on project development. This is particularly important for PPPs where the government is preparing the Medium-Term Investment Plan (MTIP) 2021-5. Projects in the MTIP will have already completed prefeasibility assessments, but the TA will help to screen for the most promising of these PPP and prepare at least one feasibility study. Contingent on the availability of additional funding, the TA is also expected to play a role in upstream transaction development in the sectors where ADB's non-sovereign operations are strategically focused.3. Second, the TA will provide gender-sensitive policy advice. Infrastructure is a significant governmental priority, but there is little research as how this infrastructure should be developed to meet the needs of women. The TA would fund a study to examine this question with the study expected to inform the operations of the government and development partners as they conceptualize solutions to Viet Nam's infrastructure needs. Policy advice will also extend to the implementation of the PPP law. Although the government is expected to have published most of the corresponding decrees and circulars before TA implementation, the Ministry of Planning and Investment is going to have ongoing needs for policy advice to adjust these documents as the first PPPs are implemented.4. Finally, it will support the capacity development of both the government and the private sector. One focus will be on helping women to emerge in infrastructure and related technical fields through sponsoring a leadership program for promising managers and an internship program to encourage more young women to enter these fields. Another focus will be on provincial leadership. Viet Nam's expertise in PPPs is clustered in the central government. For PPPs to become viable at lower levels, capacity building is a precursor. The TA will select two provinces and/or municipalities to improve their (i) technical and managerial capacity for prioritizing, screening and early-stage development of municipal PPPs, and (ii) financial capacity to implement them.5.

The TA facility will deliver following three key outputs:Output 1. Support hydrogeological study of Upper and Lower Dupi Tila aquifers with comprehensive plan for aquifer recharge. The TA will support the ongoing project through completion of hydrogeological study to assess the storage capacity of the aquifers, groundwater reserves, and recovery status. The following activities will be conducted: (i) assess the storage capacity of aquifers, threats of pollution from endogenous and exogenous process, and analyze groundwater reserve and recovery status, and (ii) explore suitable location and techniques for aquifer recharge and prepare a comprehensive plan for artificial aquifer recharge. As surface waterbodies contribute to aquifer recharge, water quality monitoring and restoration measures supported by ensuing project will directly contribute to the outcome of ongoing project. Output 2. Prepare comprehensive water quality monitoring plan for restoration of waterbodies in Dhaka watershed. The TA will support the ensuing project through preparation of comprehensive water quality monitoring plan including measures for restoration of waterbodies in Dhaka watershed. The following activities will be conducted: (i) assess supply augmentation potentials of available surface waterbodies that are partially or entirely within Dhaka City by detailed mapping, (ii) prepare a list of waterbodies with restoration potential focusing on all season storage enhancement, groundwater recharge, and enhanced ecosystem services to be supported under the project, (iii) pollution mapping including pollution levels of waterbodies, quality of receiving influents, and sources for both surface water and groundwater, (iv) identify and evaluate suitable restoration measures including technical and nature-based solutions for pollution prevention and reduction, and flow augmentation, and (v) develop a mechanism for online water quality monitoring. The results will support in preparation of the ensuing project particularly on ensuring adherence to ADB's due diligence requirements.Output 3.

Kazakhstan is facing tremendous challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the concurrent plummeting in oil prices started in early 2020, which have jointly contributed to creating an economic and social crisis of unprecedented dimensions. Despite the adoption of government programs aimed at diversifying the economy, Kazakhstan remains heavily dependent on extractive industries as more than 70% of export revenues derived from basic commodities, especially oil and gas. Such production structure, which is typical of countries affected by the so-called \"Dutch disease\", creates pronounced economic vulnerabilities amplifying the impact of the ongoing crisis. 2. At the end of March 2020, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support in the establishment of a COVID-19 Solidarity Fund for Kazakhstan to complement the government's efforts made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, The authorities' request has been motivated by the need to mitigate the impact of the ongoing health and economic crisis on the most vulnerable part of the population and preparing for the post-crisis socio-economic development. In such context, the Ministry of National Economy (MNE) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP) requested the ADB to partner with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank (WB) in the creation and management of the Solidarity Fund (SF). 3. Based on the MNE's proposal, which was further elaborated through a series of informal meetings among prospective partners, and the subsequent support provided to Kazakhstan during March-August 2020 by ADB, UNDP, WB, and other development partners, the SF will focus on delivering training programs to assist workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic finding new jobs in the post-COVID-19 economy. Initially, the SF was supposed to also assist with the provision of material relief to the population (i.e. food, medicines) and the creation of an online platform for the provision of public services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, these initiatives were covered by Asia Pacific Disaster Response (APDRF) and other government programs which was not anticipated at the time of initial negotiations. The updated request from the government is for the SF to focus on retraining and upgrading of skills for developing capabilities and expertise in industries and sectors expected to provide opportunities for business development in a post-COVID-19 environment. Joint financing and management of TA activities by ADB, UNDP, and the WB in collaboration with the government is expected to produce relevant synergies and complementarities between ADB operations and government development needs.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 1000000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54265-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/kaz-54265-001-tar"], "sectors": ["Education", "Industry and trade"], "subsectors": ["Education sector development - social protection initiatives-Technical and vocational education and training", "Small and medium enterprise development"], "country_name": "Kazakhstan", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2020-11-16 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-05-15 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-05-15 00:00:00", "approval": "2020-12-11 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-12-11 00:00:00"}},

This project is also a demonstration of support for the PRC's intended nationally determined contributions, e.g., increasing carbon sinks via wetland restoration, enhancing overall climate resilience.The project will be aligned with the following impact: rural vitalization in the YREB realized. The outputs listed below will result in the following outcome: rural living environment in Pingjiang County improved.Output 1: Water-related disaster risk management in Pingjiang County improved. This output includes measures to mitigate impacts of severe flooding and occurrence of landslides and natural hazards in Pingjiang County, including (i) construction of flood embankments and nature-based measures such as ecological wetlands and conservation parks and improvement of degraded areas to maintain bank stability, protect biodiversity, and regulate flooding events; and (ii) establishment of conservation forests and riparian vegetation zones to control water and soil loss and nonpoint source pollution in the Miluo River. These activities will generate employment opportunities for residents, including women.Output 2: Rural waste and sanitation management in Pingjiang County improved. This output will address environmental degradation through improvements in environmental infrastructure. The output includes improvement of access to and upgrade of solid waste management services and wastewater treatment facilities across 214 township schools, 33 township hospitals, and rural residents through improved county-wide inclusive sanitation which considers the most appropriate and innovative technology and service delivery method, including public private partnerships. Output 3: Integrated water resources management planning and decision support capacity enhanced. This output will strengthen the PCG's institutional coordination capacity for environmental and disaster risk management. The output will enhance integrated water resources management planning and decision support capacity across local government agencies through the development of a decision support system. Environmental management information systems will be incorporated in the decision support system to improve institutional coordination for integrated water resources and disaster risk management, asset management, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for forests and wetland conservation areas, river water quality and environmental flows (including water supply to downstream areas), and flood early warning. Output 4: Green procurement and ecological farming practices piloted. This output involves piloting of (i) green procurement programs in schools, hospitals, and tourism operators to support the development of green supply chains that will reduce environmentally damaging wastes, such as plastic wastes; and encourage recycling and reuse initiatives; (ii) community-based solid waste management training and awareness-raising programs in schools, hospitals, and tourism operators to support green consumption and circular economy principles; and (iii) demonstration farms to be established to showcase sustainable ecological farming best practices, such as adoption of organic fertilizers, integrated pest management, and improved farm waste management, to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Pathways for organic certification of local agribusinesses to support green industries will also be explored in conjunction with identification of downstream markets. Some jobs for residents, including women, will be created during the construction of relevant facilities.  Innovative features will be included in the project design, covering (i) county-wide inclusive sanitation and solid waste collection facilities using best practices with consideration of public private partnership delivery, if appropriate; (ii) nature-based measures such as wetland parks and conservation forests to improve water quality and manage flood risks; and (iii) county-wide integrated water resources and disaster risk management. The experiences and knowledge gained through this project will be deployed in other poor rural areas in the PRC.The project design will incorporate lessons from international best practices and build on previous ADB-financed projects supporting rural vitalization, such as importance of (i) climate-smart agricultural and ecological farming practices; (ii) decentralized sanitation systems for rural villages; (iii) nature-based solutions to address flooding and other risks from natural hazards; (iv) development, participation, and empowerment of rural communities and rural enterprises; (v) effective institutional coordination and governance arrangements, including the river chief system; (vi) sustainable operation and maintenance; and (vii) monitoring and evaluation systems.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 220930000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/53052-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-pp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-pra", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-rrp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-pam", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-gap", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-rp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-53052-001-iee"], "sectors": ["Agriculture, natural resources and rural development", "Education"], "subsectors": ["Land-based natural resources management-Rural sanitation-Water-based natural resources management", "Education sector development"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2019-10-23 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2020-07-13 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-07-24 00:00:00", "mrm": "2020-09-09 00:00:00", "approval": "2020-11-27 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-09-20 00:00:00"}},

The project will have the following outcome: volume of green finance provided by the city and rural commercial banking sector in Hebei province increased. This outcome will be achieved through three outputs.Output 1: The Bank of Xingtai's green finance system established. The project will help the Bank of Xingtai (i) adopt domestically and internationally accepted green finance taxonomy as the basis for subproject eligibility and selection criteria, (ii) establish an ESG framework for monitoring subproject performances, and (iii) implement the GRI principles for reporting and disclosing subproject ESG information to the public. The establishment and adoption of the green finance system will be accomplished through (i) the operationalization of a sophisticated green finance IT system that will apply domestic and international green finance taxonomies to define what constitutes \"green\", and (ii) implements the ESG and GRI guidelines. The EU's sustainable finance taxonomy, which is among the most comprehensive anywhere, will be incorporated in the subproject eligibility criteria.Output 2: Green finance lending by the Bank of Xingtai initiated and increased. The project will support the Bank of Xingtai's establishment of a green finance lending business line and help it increase its green lending volume during project implementation and beyond. The ADB project funds will serve as a catalyst for green financing provided by the private sector and other commercial sources. Specifically, the ADB loan of 170 million is expected to leverage 170 million in counterpart funding from the Bank of Xingtai and an additional 340 million from private sector and commercial sources such as other commercial banks. Each euro of ADB financing will leverage 3 or more from other sources, and significantly expand the project's green finance and development impact.Output 3: The Bank of Xingtai's environment, social, and governance and related institutional capacities improved. The project will help the Bank of Xingtai strengthen its institutional capacity. It will develop an ESG risk management framework. The Bank of Xingtai's environmental and social management system (ESMS) will be improved, a dedicated safeguard unit established, and environmental and social safeguard training provided for its staff. The project will also support the improvement of the Bank of Xingtai's financial and risk management capacity through training to bank staff on credit assessment and treasury operations. This will help integrate the ESG risks to the bank's credit review process and extend the sourcing of other low-cost funds such as from the capital markets. To disseminate the experience of the Bank of Xingtai and support replication, extensive knowledge-sharing programs on green finance in general, and green finance business models for commercial banks in particular, will be conducted with the participation of other city and rural commercial banks across Hebei and other provinces.

{"original_id": "54457-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "COVID-19 Emergency Response Project", "description": "Despite significant improvements in recent years, Georgia's public health system remains vulnerable to the health burden posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis. The health sector capacity is limited, physical health infrastructure is inadequate, and there is a lack of trained medical personnel to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out-of-pocket spending has been declining after the introduction of the Universal Healthcare Program in 2013, but still accounted for 54.8% of total health spending in 2017. This points to an underlying vulnerability for low income groups, which are particularly at risk as COVID-19 unfolds. About 17.5% of Georgia's population is older than 60 years, while 3.3% of the population is older than 80 years. This poses additional challenges in dealing with the COVID-19 emergency since evidence from other countries suggests that the older populations, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, are at higher risk of contracting the disease and, if infected, often require more intensive care.According to the Global Health Security Index, Georgia's health capacity in clinics, hospitals and community care centers scores low: 18.3 out of 100. This is largely due to the deficit of nursing staff and low hospital bed density. Georgia has only 47.3 nurses per 10,000 population and 26 hospital beds per 10,000 population compared with neighboring countries such as Armenia which has 42 beds per 10,000 population. Critical skills gaps exist in Georgia's healthcare sector and a number of health workers and laboratory staff have to be trained to be able to respond to COVID-19. Some 62% of frontline medical doctors, who are higher risk of infection, are women. With the acceleration of virus transmission rate since September 2020, Georgia's health system is increasingly overwhelmed. According to MoILHSA, as of the second week of November, about 4,500 beds in more than 30 hospitals were already occupied by COVID-19 patients, while only 250 beds were available. The Ministry is working to increase the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients to 8,500 by early December. Health workers are increasingly contracting the disease. The number of infected health workers surpassed 1,700 or 5% of total number of infected as of end October 2020. More resources are needed for management of severe cases, prevention of onward virus transmission and alleviation of strains on health-care services. The government needs support to augment its capacity and constrained financial and human resources to ensure effective and timely lifesaving efforts and respond to the impact of COVID-19.The proposed support from the APDRF will help finance immediate needs and deliver appropriate medical services where required. The government has indicated ADB's support would be used for improvement of laboratory diagnostic and testing capacity, procurement of personal protective equipment and other medical equipment to help the government meet its most urgent needs. Recognizing the unpredictable nature of the situation and the concurrent inflow of support from other sources, flexibility is required, along with close coordination with various sources and partners. Any supplies funded from APDRF grant will be coordinated with other support from development partners to avoid duplication.The APDRF grant will complement ADB's comprehensive package of support to Georgia designed to contain COVID-19 impact. The package includes a $100 million loan approved in May 2020 and a $200 million loan approved in October 2020 to respond to Georgia's immediate health and socioeconomic needs and support a return to inclusive economic growth by addressing the longstanding institutional fragilities in social protection, fiscal and debt management that were exacerbated by the pandemic. ADB has also provided grant support to Georgia in August 2020 to procure PCR equipment for the COVID-19 health response, funded under the regional technical assistance project. The new equipment will augment Georgia's PCR testing capacity and help the authorities to better trace and contain the spread of the virus.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 2500000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54457-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/geo-54457-001-grj"], "sectors": ["Health"], "subsectors": ["Health sector development and reform"], "country_name": "Georgia", "timestamps": {"fact_finding_start": "2020-11-26 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2020-11-26 00:00:00", "mrm": "2021-01-08 00:00:00", "approval": "2020-12-03 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-12-03 00:00:00"}},

The KSTA is in line with the framework of Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), wherein both DMCs and the ADB have pledged support to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the related Financing for Development Agenda. The proposed KSTA will capacitate the NSSs of the participating DMCs to produce relevant, accurate and timely economic statistical indicators that are imperative to measure the progress towards the SDGs, particularly Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; and Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. The proposed KSTA which is part of the approved workplan of ERCD, supports Strategy 2030's operational plan (OP6) strengthen governance, through enhancing the capacity of the DMCs to produce economic information needed for rigorous evidence-based policy making and program monitoring. Further, the statistics to be produced in the participating DMCs will enable the respective governments and the ADB to track the progress of the country and sector specific gainful participation in global and regional value chains (OP7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration). Currently, due to similar statistical capacity building initiatives undertaken so far by EROD-SDI, ERCD produces global and regional value chain participation indices and analyses, including regional spillover analysis, for more than 20 regional member countries. As a result of this proposed KSTA the number of DMCs for which comprehensive value chain participation information and advanced measures of regional cooperation and integration (RCI) are available is expected to increase by at least 10, including many in the Pacific.The proposed KSTA will also enable the ADB to expand its economic databases by the inclusion of critical statistics relevant to the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region, including fragile and conflict-affected situations and small island developing states. These databases are currently being employed by ERCD to provide economic impact analysis for the purposes of COVID-19 Active Response Expenditure Support (CARES) program. Due to ERCD's past and ongoing statistical capacity building work in Thailand and other countries in ASEAN, the department was able to readily compile the necessary data and provide the analysis required for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) .

Like the first one, this proposed cluster TA will support the delivery of a mix of evaluations and validations, including some complementary knowledge and outreach activities. The C KSTA will be divided into three subprojects. Subproject 1 will support the delivery of evaluations to be mobilized in 2020 and completed through 2022, as set out in the IED Work Program 2021-2022. Subproject 2 is structured along the same lines and will support the delivery of evaluations in 2022 2023, based on the next three-year work program for 2022 2023.

On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Confirmed COVID-19 cases across South Asia are increasing. The first case in Bhutan was confirmed on 6 March 2020, when a foreign tourist tested positive on 3 March 2020. Until mid-May, positive cases remained below 10. Thereafter, the number of positive cases started increasing rapidly since Bhutanese returning from overseas, reaching 77 on 1 July 2020, of which 50 have recovered with no deaths. Due to stringent measures and lengthier quarantine requirement, i.e., 21 days, Bhutan successfully managed to avoid local transmission so far. In Maldives, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) reported the first case on 7 March 2020. As one of the most densely populated cities in the world, Maldives' capital Mal recorded a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the first weeks following the first confirmed local transmission on April 15. As of 2 July 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 2,382. The country has recorded 1,954 recoveries and 9 deaths. The health systems in both countries are severely strained by increased workload on health workers to carry out surveillance and testing, prioritization of health managers and frontline health workers in preparing for COVID-19 cases at the expense of other health system priorities, stockouts of infection control supplies, and disruptions to routine services including outreach services that are essential for maintaining primary health care.

The outputs will be (i) the COVID-19 response and health system strengthening measures implemented; (ii) affected sectors and businesses supported to prevent job losses from the economic downturn; and (iii) dedicated social safety net funds for social protection and compensation for economic losses of low-income households expanded. The program is aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2019 -2023 for Uzbekistan, especially on reducing economic and social disparities, strengthening economic governance, supporting private sector development, and promoting regional cooperation and integration.ADB's value addition, including lessons learned from crisis lending. The program is based on extensive policy dialogue with the government and development partner coordination. It draws on lessons from ADB's experience with Countercyclical Support Facility loans during different emergency and crisis situations. These lessons are even more pertinent for the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, which requires parallel interventions on several fronts. The lessons include (i) the timeliness of the countercyclical response to stabilize the economy and protect livelihoods; (ii) targeting of social assistance to prevent large-scale unemployment and poverty; (iii) channeling support through the government budget to ensure coordination, and efficient execution and monitoring, of expenditures; (iv) ensuring adequate support for the government's rapidly evolving financing needs without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability; and (v) placing the emergency support within a medium- to long-term development context with flexibility to make changes. The program is part of ADB's comprehensive country assistance, which is aligned with the government's development strategy. It complements the ongoing and proposed policy dialogue and program, project, and technical assistance (TA) pipeline, aimed at improving (i) health systems; (ii) technical and vocational skills; (iii) the enabling environment for private sector development, including SMEs and public private partnerships; (iv) public resource management and SOE reforms; and (v) regional cooperation and integration. ADB's support for strengthening the health sector capacity under the Primary Health Care Improvement Project, a grant of $1.56 million allocated for Uzbekistan to procure medical supplies and equipment under its regional TA for COVID-19, and the proposed emergency assistance loan of $100 million under the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project will complement the program. ADB's overall health sector support is a unique value addition, as it not only helps enhance the testing, diagnosis, and clinical treatment capacity of COVID-19 patients but also strengthens the preventive health system to improve the country's resilience to future public health disasters. Together with ongoing and planned health-related projects, the program will generate a substantial regional public good by strengthening regional cooperation among CAREC countries to control the spread of COVID-19 through sharing of information, medical supplies, and staff for pandemic management and the adoption of WHO-recommended standards and best practices. The program also facilitates regional integration through its support for export-oriented SMEs and cross-border trade in goods and services. ADB's proposed policy-based loans for 2020 will complement the support for SMEs and financial inclusion, financial market development, and SOE reforms in the energy sector.The program implementation will be monitored by an ongoing TA through allocating additional resources. This TA will also support the medium-term public sector reforms including (i) the policy formulation for emergency expenditures and social transfers under the medium-term budget framework; (ii) strengthening investment planning and outcome-based budgeting for health and social expenditures; (iii) developing a formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfer system in line with local governments' enhanced role in service delivery during disasters; (iv) debt and fiscal risk management; (v) risk-based banking supervision; and (vi) developing suitable financial services in state-owned banks for businesses affected by the pandemic.

But the recessionary effects of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have now significantly worsened Kazakhstan's macroeconomic outlook. The country's non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 is now set to widen to 11%, from 8% in 2019 and an originally expected 7% for 2020, which is also a result of the current discretionary countercyclical efforts. This situation will interrupt the downward trajectory from 10% in 2017. Early health and epidemic-control responses. The pre-COVID-19 efforts in early January to build health system response capacity were effective, as were the strict social containment measures implemented since March (i.e., right after the first confirmed cases in the country). But the medical emergency remains a challenge. Economic and social costs of COVID-19 response. The non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow down the spread of the virus imposed significant restrictions on Kazakhstan's non-oil economy and seriously hurt the country's macroeconomic outlook. Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicate that (i) by the end of March, 48% of employees had been put on leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for the second quarter of 2020, an estimated 40% of employees could be put on leave without pay and 12% could be terminated. Tourism, hospitality, education, food services, retail trade, and manufacturing were among the areas hit hardest. Also, women tend to be particularly affected by restrictions on economic activity they account for more than 65% of the labor force in areas such as hospitality, education, and wholesale and retail trade; own or manage most of the microenterprises; and also represent a significant share of the informal labor market. Various estimates point to a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown. Pandemic-caused global recession reaching Kazakhstan. The economic difficulties that Kazakhstan began experiencing in March are now being compounded by (i) a new oil price shock (and the collapse in the prices of other commodities), and (ii) the sudden stop of global capital flows into emerging markets. These direct consequences of the global pandemic halved the prices of 85% of Kazakhstan's export goods . Exchange rate pressures were eased by allowing a 20% depreciation of the tenge and by raising the policy rate, which increased the debt-servicing costs across the economy. Pressures on the asset quality of banks are already constraining the provision of new liquidity to microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This added to the ongoing disruptions outlined in para 4. Without a fiscal response, the economy will contract by 5% or more. The poor and vulnerable, including women, can be disproportionately affected. Poverty rates may reach 11% 13% (from 6.6% now).Robust and comprehensive government response. To counter this sequence of shocks, the government decided on a comprehensive package of medical, public health, and countercyclical fiscal measures totaling T5.9 trillion (8% 9% of GDP, or about $13 billion). The government will self-fund more than 81% of this, including with additional transfers of $4.7 billion $5 billion from the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK). The remaining $2 billion of net new financing needs require foreign and domestic debt issuance. The sound pre-shock macroeconomic management record of the government is instrumental in giving credibility to its recent monetary and macroprudential policy decisions in banking and exchange-rate markets. The proposed assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will help the government mitigate the medical and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kazakhstan, and support its (i) immediate COVID-19 health policy response, (ii) social protection and employment recovery measures, and (iii) overall stimulus measures. Kazakhstan's CPRO eligibility is summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 4.

{"original_id": "45007-009", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program - Tranche 3", "description": "Ulaanbaatar city is home to more than 1.44 million people. The central city core with comprehensive utility services is surrounded by vast, substandard, and unserved ger areas of about 100 square kilometers. Ger areas accommodate about 60% of the city's population (about 840,000 inhabitants) and have spread and expanded through successive waves of migration. These settlements of low- and medium-income households are characterized by loosely aligned plots, creating irregular unpaved pathways. The majority of households living here have land tenure. Lack of basic urban infrastructure and services in ger areas has caused severe pollution that threatens city residents' health. Obsolete household coal stoves for heating, and traffic congestion caused by unplanned road networks have helped generate some of the highest levels of air pollution in the world. Households exclusive reliance on open pit latrines and a poor solid waste collection system has led to poor sanitation, along with limited access to water supplied by water kiosks. There is a lack of basic social and public facilities, such as green spaces, parks, sports centers, kindergartens, and primary health centers. The upgrading of ger areas is constrained by inadequate urban infrastructure, lack of urban planning, poor urban services, and limited public spaces and facilities.On 12 December 2013, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program using multitranche financing facility (MFF) modality, comprising three tranches. On 16 April 2020, the President approved the extension of the MFF availability period from 9 years to 10 years (or from 31 December 2022 to 11 December 2023) to ensure the timely implementation of tranche 3. The total program cost is $320.00 million, of which $163.70 million will be financed by ADB; $96.00 million by the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB); and up to 50.00 million euros ($60.30 million equivalent at the time of approval) parallel cofinancing by the European Investment Bank. This program is the result of a successful policy dialogue between ADB and the MUB that catalyzed the (i) integration of ger areas in the Ulaanbaatar city master plan for the first time in December 2013, and (ii) adoption of a priority service and economic hubs (subcenters) development strategy in ger areas as a catalyst for more polycentric and inclusive city development. Under this program, a road map has been developed to establish a network of well-developed city subcenters to provide jobs, housing, and economic opportunities with reduced soil and air pollution. The program has introduced a paradigm shift and replicable mechanism to systematically extend modern infrastructure and key social facilities to ger area. The framework financing agreement was signed on 9 December 2013 and ratified by the Mongolian Parliament on 23 May 2014. Tranche 3 of the MFF will align with the program strategic road map to support the redevelopment of two additional subcenters in the eastern and western ger areas (Sharkhad and Tolgoit).", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 62300000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/45007-009/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-pp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-lna-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-pra", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-fam", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-pfrr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-gap", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-004-45007-005-45007-009-smr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-earf", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-emp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-iee", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-rp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/mon-45007-009-rf"], "sectors": ["Education", "Transport", "Water and other urban infrastructure and services"], "subsectors": ["Education sector development", "Urban roads and traffic management", "Urban policy, institutional and capacity development-Urban slum development"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"mrm": "2020-04-17 00:00:00", "approval": "2020-06-26 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-09-27 00:00:00"}},

In spite of vast renewable energy potential, Mongolia depends on 93% of total electricity production from coal fired thermal power plants. Coal has also been used as the primary source for heating. As a result, the energy sector becomes the major contributor to large greenhouse gas emissions and serious air pollution in the country. The air pollution level in Ulaanbaatar and other towns have become worse than that in cities such as Beijing and New Delhi. UNICEF warned that this has become the public health crisis, especially among children. Nevertheless, the use of coal cannot be reduced to meet growing domestic demand for electricity and heating. To be worse, the peak demand for electricity has almost been reaching to the present generation capacity limit. Under the situation, the country has overcome any power shortfall through more expensive power import from Russia. Thus, the energy security and social and economic impacts have been toward conflicting and complicating situation. To tackle the dilemma, the government issued the State Policy on Energy, 2015 2030 to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030. ADB's country partnership strategy and country operations business plan (COBP) for Mongolia responded to this priority to expand renewable energy even in remote and less developed regions, and to enable air quality and carbon footprint improvements. Subsequently, the government's mid-term plan for 2019 2023 includes concrete activities for renewable energy development. For this purpose, this transaction technical assistance (TA) was programmed for 2019 and the ensuing loan project for 2021 in the COBP, 2020 2021.Given the strategy and rationale, following are the project outputs of the ensuing project:(i) Output 1: Transmission strengthened to help evacuate more renewable energy to grid. (ii) Output 2: Pilot pumped storage hydropower generation assessed for detailed engineering studies. (iii) Output 3: Pilot geothermal heat and power generation assessed for detailed engineering studies. (iv) Output 4: Advance heating technologies deployed. The project impact will be increased renewable energy capacity, and the outcome will be increased and diversified clean energy supply schemes.The ensuing project is estimated to cost $100 million.

Henan Province has the largest population in PRC. In 2018, the primary energy is highly dependent upon coal which accounts for around 77.6% as compared to 59.0% in the national average. While Henan Province has reduced the dependence on coal from 84.3% in 2010, the province becomes one of the major contributors of air pollution in the greater BTH region. Henan Province records it air pollutant emissions in terms of PM2.5 (62 ug/m3), particulate matter less than 10 micrometer in diameter (PM10) (106 ug/m3), SO2 (21 ug/m3), and NOx (41 ug/m3), all of which are far above the national air quality category I standard, and of the World Health Organization standard. Since the air pollution is largely sourced from coal burning, the medium and long-term energy development plan in Henan province (2012-2030) was issued in 2012 to accelerate renewable energy penetration into the grid, enhance energy efficiency, and expand natural gas supply network. In 2018, the provincial government also issued the Three Year Action Plan for Henan Province to Combat Blue Sky War (2018 2020), which targeted to (i) reduce PM2.5 to 58 ug/m3 by 2020, and (ii) achieve 35 ug/m3 of national air quality category II standard by 2023.

In the education sector, ADB currently supports the (i) Skills Sector Enhancement Program to ensure equitable access to high-quality and relevant demand-driven skills training; and (ii) Science and Technology Human Resource Development Project to strengthen science and technology education and research facilities, in order to nurture technology-oriented graduates equipped with market-relevant skills and an entrepreneurial spirit. With the Health System Enhancement Project in 2018, ADB re-engaged in the sector after 20 years and currently supports the development of an equity-based, more responsive, and comprehensive primary health care system in Sri Lanka, in particular, in rural areas and lagging regions. New support has been proposed to ADB, namely the (i) Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program to enhance the quality and relevance and learning outcomes of STEM subjects along with 21st century skills at the senior secondary level, essential for preparing Sri Lankan graduates for a knowledge-centered economy; and (ii) proposed Innovation Capacity Development in Higher Education Project.The government appreciated the design and implementation of ADB's prior technical assistance (TA), which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants to project preparation and implementation and is nearly completed. The government has requested similar support for project implementation and future project processing. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity and competencies of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. Successful outcomes of ADB support in the health and education sectors require consolidating and sharing lessons and good practices, combined with dedicated capacity building for project design and implementation. ADB support in strengthening government capacity can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected areas. Second, ADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs across the three subsectors in education (secondary, TVET, and higher education) and health. Working across these three subsectors and with the health system, ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of education and health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 2700000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/54061-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/sri-54061-001-tar"], "sectors": ["Education", "Health"], "subsectors": ["Education sector development", "Disease control of communicable disease-Health system development"], "country_name": "Sri Lanka", "timestamps": {"approval": "2020-03-09 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-03-10 00:00:00"}},

{"original_id": "53277-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Supporting Education and Skills Development Facility", "description": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting education and skills development initiatives at the state-level, with the aim of increasing employability and productivity of the youth entering the labor force. Each of the state-level projects endeavors to improve the overall TVET system by upgrading training infrastructure, enhancing teacher qualifications, and delivering skills programs to respond to demands from local labor markets. A new program has been proposed to address the quality of basic and secondary education and strengthen learning outcomes from school education both at the central and state levels. It is important to enhance the capacity and competencies of executing and implementing agencies in order to ensure quality project designs, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. For successful outcomes of ADB support in the areas of education and skills development, consolidating and sharing the lessons and good practices are essential together with dedicated capacity building for project designs and implementation. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility would bridge capability gaps, apply best practices, and foster emerging innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. Capacity building support will be provided through the provision of incremental consulting services to enhance project preparatory and implementation capacity. The TA facility is listed in the country operations business plan (COBP) for India, 2020-2022, with the title Supporting Education and Skills Development Capacity. The TA facility will provide project preparation, capacity building, undertaking due diligence, and increasing readiness for pipeline projects, including those identified in COBP for India, 2020-2022. It will initially support:(i) Supporting School Education Program in India (tentative title)(ii) Kerala Skills Development Project (tentative title)(iii) Supporting State-Level Skills Development Project (for Assam) These projects are all in the education sector, including TVET subsector, and have similar due diligence requirements. The TA facility approach is suitable as it will enhance project preparation efficiency, enable the incorporation of lessons in new project designs, and improve project implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts and consultants to be mobilized for similar due diligence activities; (ii) facilitating learning on project processing and implementation across different projects; (iii) creating synergies form working with common expertise and improving knowledge transfer; and (iv) strengthening coordination among various technical inputs and capacity building opportunities. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs by minimizing the resources of standalone transaction TA projects. The TA facility will also support ongoing projects as required and agreed with the project's respective executing and implementing agencies.

This in turn supports inclusive, private sector-led economic growth. The three consecutive phases of PSDI implemented since 2007 have helped Pacific DMCs carry out reforms and introduce new policies to improve conditions for private sector development and investment, responding to related needs and opportunities as they evolved. PSDI has expended $60.83 million during the first three phases which funded more than 600 subprojects. This included grant cofinancing of $54.73 million from Australia and New Zealand which reflects the importance and value their governments place on introducing reforms and building capacity for private sector development in the Pacific. The technical assistance (TA) for Phase IV (PSDI IV) will build on Phase III achievements across six core areas of focus: access to finance, business law reform, state-owned enterprise reform, public- private partnerships, competition and consumer protection, and the economic empowerment of women. PSDI IV will retain these areas of focus and also respond to climate change and labor mobility by incorporating these issues into relevant subprojects. A 2018 review of PSDI by ADB's Independent Evaluation Department (IED) found that the first three phases helped provide several important inputs necessary for establishing modern, functioning private sectors in Pacific DMCs. While concluding that PSDI remained relevant and well-aligned with these DMCs' needs, IED made recommendations aimed at improving outcomes. These recommendations have been incorporated into PSDI IV. PSDI IV is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2030 and aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB's Pacific Approach, 2016 -2020.

From 2018, the government has requested several interventions in tertiary education development. Building upon the achievements of past and ongoing education sector projects as well as lessons from recent engagement in tertiary education, ADB will help the government make strategic investments for tertiary education catering to specific industries' demand for improved human capital and contribute to socioeconomic transformation. Lessons from the preparatory work for the Improving Computer and Software Engineering Tertiary Education Project are (i) that wider stakeholder consultants (especially with industry and students) are crucial to inform the project design and convince universities and the government to adopt innovative approaches, and (ii) that quality and relevance improvement measures require several rounds of discussion to gather momentum for institution-wide buy-in. A technical assistance providing strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants has been highly appreciated by the government and stakeholders as the technical areas require understanding of latest industry requirements, international good practices, and innovative approaches successful in other countries. ADB will focus its efforts in specific disciplines or universities to provide integrated supports in developing new and upgraded higher education programs, addressing the gaps in quality and relevance of those programs.

Contributing to this is the absence of well-planned rural infrastructure, which undermines agricultural productivity and increases vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. A key cause is the weak capacities and poor coordination in the planning, design, and implementation of projects of rural infrastructure stakeholders comprising local, state, and central government; private sector (consultants and contractors); and academic institutions. Exposure to new innovations and good practices in the agriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector is limited, resulting in the continuation of a _business as usual_ approach. The result is persistently slow progress in meeting targets for rural development, design, construction supervision, performance, and sustainability of the assets, as well as limited consideration of external factors, such as climate change.Two of the seven operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 are (i) promoting rural development and food security; and (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability. ADB's investments in these areas have generated jobs, raised rural incomes, and reduced poverty. The Strategy 2030 emphasizes the need for (i) increasing the focus on the water food energy security nexus; (ii) improving market connectivity and agriculture value chain linkages; (iii) increasing agricultural productivity and food security; and (iv) enhancing food safety.

All ensuing projects are among the Government's priorities for energy sector development under Uzbekistan 2030, and will require similar scope of safeguard, financial management and economic assessments. Social (labor), human resources, and training needs assessments will also be undertaken for the policy component of the proposed Gas Sector Development Program.Natural gas is the most important indigenous source of energy in Uzbekistan and is regarded as one of the driving forces of the country's economy. At present, the energy sector contributes to over 20% of national tax revenues and 18% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Natural gas is over 80% of the country's energy mix and 85% of electricity generated. Uzbekistan's aging and dilapidated infrastructure in the whole energy chain increasingly results in system inefficiencies, unreliable gas and electricity supply that dampens the economic development and business confidence, and uneven access to electricity across provinces contributing towards widening regional income disparities. The obsolete energy transmission and distribution systems have developed serious problems overtime, such as increasingly frequent electricity blackouts and insufficient gas available especially during peak demand times in the winter, putting social service systems such as education and health care at risk.In 2017, Uzbekistan initiated comprehensive economic reforms liberalizing its exchange rate to solve long-standing difficulties associated with limited access to foreign exchange and requirements to surrender foreign exchange resulted in structural and economic distortions. The liberalization of the foreign exchange regime and local currency devaluation created additional challenges to energy utilities massively distorting their value of assets, capital structures and revenue generation under existing governance and financial management frameworks. To recover the sustainability of energy utilities, the government launched several initiatives and legislative acts for sector reforms that includes: (i) development of cost reflective energy tariffs (ii) adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and disclosures and (iii) strengthening financial management and corporate governance frameworks", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 3375000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/52322-002/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/uzb-52322-002-tar"], "sectors": ["Energy"], "subsectors": ["Electricity transmission and distribution-Energy utility services-Oil and gas transmission and distribution"], "country_name": "Uzbekistan", "timestamps": {"approval": "2019-01-28 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-03-31 00:00:00"}},

{"original_id": "51418-001", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region—Shandong Clean Heating and Cooling Project", "description": "The proposed project will implement three clean heating and cooling subprojects to accelerate air pollution abatement in Shandong Province. The heating and cooling projects proposed are innovative, as they will combine renewable energy technologies and waste heat recovered from industry and power plants to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of heat production and refrigeration, and thereby reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the heat island effect in urban areas. An overview of each subproject is provided below.Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year. A feedstock assessment showed that only 12% of the available agriculture waste will be consumed by the biomass plant; (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. Deep-well geothermal offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current practice of using coal-based space heating. Deep-well reinjection technology will be used to extract and exchange heat from the underground water, which will then be filtered and recharged back to the same aquifer; and (iv) For a few newly built resident communities not covered by the heating network and where geothermal resource is not available, distributed gas-fired boilers will be used. This subproject enables Jinan to fully utilize waste heat in the neighboring regions, to form a waste heat-dominated heating system, with distributed energy supply from biomass, geothermal and natural gas as supplementary.Subproject 2: Shanghe Coal-Free Clean Heating Demonstration Subproject. This subproject covers the urban area of Shanghe County, the semi-urban area of 11 towns and 80,000 rural households where coal-fired stoves or coal-fired boilers are common for space heating. The subproject will use geothermal energy as the main heat source to replace coal-fired heating. Other clean options, such as air-source heat pump, are selected as distributed heating source where the pipeline network is not available. Gas-fired boilers will be an auxiliary heat source. This subproject also plans to retrofit total 660,400 m2 of urban buildings and 30,000 rural households to improve their energy efficiency. Based on the available resources, heavily polluting coal-fired stoves in 80,000 rural households will be replaced by air-to-air heat pumps, air-to-water heat pumps, heat-storage radiators, carbon crystal plate radiators and small household gas heaters. This subproject will play an important role in, and have demonstration effect to, other counties in the northern PRC who are also facing similar air quality issues caused by the winter heating.Subproject 3: East Jinan Low-Emission Combined District Heating and Cooling Subproject. East Jinan is where the central business district located. The large amount of heating and cooling demands in this area requires a low-emission system supplying both heat and cooling. For heating supply, two options will be used: (i) Industrial waste heat through long-distance pipeline will be used to supply heat to 6.2 million m2 buildings; and (ii) Electrode boilers with heat storage will use off-peak electricity at night, and then deliver hot water to the households in the day time to heat up to 700,000 m2 area. For district cooling, two technologies will be adopted: (i) Ice storage, which uses off-peak electricity during the night and stores the cooling energy in the form of ice. During peak hours in the daytime, ice is melted to provide cooling; and (ii) When the cooling demand is large enough, lithium bromide absorption chiller driven by the waste heat from the power plant will be used to deliver cold water to the consumers through long-distance pipelines. The subproject aims to expand the area of waste heat supply, and at the same time use off-peak electricity to produce and store heating and cooling capacity to improve the waste heat utilization and shift peak load.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 400660000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/51418-001/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-pp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-apfs", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-pra", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-tar", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-rrp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-pam", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-gap", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-emr-2", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-sddr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-emr-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-emr-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-emr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-5", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-2", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-3", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-4", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-eia-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-iee-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-51418-001-eia"], "sectors": ["Energy"], "subsectors": ["Conventional energy generation-Energy efficiency and conservation-Renewable energy generation - biomass and waste-Renewable energy generation - geothermal"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2018-06-06 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2018-08-21 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2018-08-22 00:00:00", "mrm": "2018-09-27 00:00:00", "approval": "2018-12-13 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2021-09-22 00:00:00"}},

The TA supports the implementation of Loan 3749-INO: Advanced Knowledge and Skills for Sustainable Growth Project (AKSI). The project loan aims to improve Indonesia's higher-education system to support sustainable economic growth. It will upgrade four public universities: the university of Malikussalleh, the university of Jambi, and the University of Riau in Sumatra; and the Indonesia University of Education in Bandung, West Java to provide high-quality and demand-based programs. The loan project's impact will be increased income and productivity of the working age population, and the outcome will be strengthened access, relevance, and quality of targeted universities. The TA supports the following innovative elements of the loan project: (i) linking universities with industry in research and education, (ii) measuring and monitoring quality and relevance of education and research, and (iii) collaboration with international partners and stakeholders. The TA outputs are: (i) initial phase of the loan project implementation supported, and (ii) entrepreneurship and technology pilot assessments in higher education prepared.On 13 March 2020, ADB approved $0.5 million funding for the TA financed on a grant basis by the High-Level Technology Fund (with Government of Japan as financing partner) and administered by ADB, along with a change in scope and implementation arrangements. This brought the total TA amount of $1.15 million to $1.65 million. This increase in TA amount will support MOEC in (a) designing a digital credentialing system for tertiary education in Indonesia which would employ blockchain technology and (b) further development of the Indonesia Cyber Education (ICE) Institute's system design, business process, quality assurance mechanism, business model, online courses registration, and users registration infrastructure. This aligns with the government's priority to advance the next generation of online education in Indonesia and will be included in the medium-term investment plan for higher education. MOEC has assigned the Universitas Terbuka to lead the development of ICE Institute together with partner universities from all over Indonesia. The ICE Institute would become the marketplace where students could obtain online courses for their study, under the new academic regulation that allows these credit-bearing online courses to be part of their study programs in their respective universities. Deploying blockchain technology will enhance tracking and recording tertiary education student credentials and assure trust amongst the stakeholders including the universities, students, parents, employers, government and industry. The ICE Institute will provide the quality assurance system for online learning in Indonesia and will facilitate the registration of online courses from Indonesian universities, as well as online courses from international universities and global massive open online courses platforms.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 1650000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/50395-007/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ino-50395-007-tar", "https://www.adb.org/publications/improving-skills-electricity-sector-indonesia"], "sectors": ["Education"], "subsectors": ["Tertiary"], "country_name": "Indonesia", "timestamps": {"approval": "2018-12-11 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-10-29 00:00:00"}},
{"original_id": "50098-002", "project_or_tender": "P", "name": "Northern Mountain Provinces Transport Connectivity Project", "description": "The project will improve and upgrade two road stretches totaling 198 km that connect several towns and districts in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Yen Bai to the Noi Bai Lao Cai Expressway. These road stretches will connect to other main roads under the Lao Cai province transport development master plan to improve network connectivity with the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Expressway. The existing roads pass through very difficult terrain with high mountains or large rivers, so many substandard curves and grades have been adopted. Their conditions are poor; the average travel speed is 25 km per hour and several sections are not passable year round. Therefore, a major rehabilitation or improvement is required to accommodate the expected traffic growth due to the current economic development of the region.The improved connectivity will (i) provide reliable access to basic social services such as education, health care, job training, and emergency disaster relief, and (ii) increase economic and employment opportunities for the people of the northwestern provinces, especially the poor ethnic minorities. The enhanced connectivity to the Noi Bai Lao Cai Expressway will provide further opportunities of cross-border trade with the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The improved roads will help save travel time and costs, hence reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The improvement and upgrade works will ensure consistency of standards over the entire road stretches, including climate resilience features namely slope protection measures in areas prone to landslides and rockfalls, raising and/or reconstructing highway embankments and bridges along road sections prone to dangerous flooding, and increasing cross-drainage capacity. The project will include awareness campaigns for road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking which will enable the vulnerable ethnic minorities to cope with possible negative impacts of the project roads.", "source": "ABD", "status": "Active", "budget": 192840000.0, "url": "https://www.adb.org/projects/50098-002/main", "document_urls": ["https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-apfs", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-pam-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-pp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-lna", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-rrp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-pam", "https://www.adb.org/vi/projects/documents/50098-002-project-data-sheet", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-gms-corridor-connectivity-enhancement-pptar", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-gms-corridor-connectivity-enhancement-ipsa", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-smr-3", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-smr-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-smr-2", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-smr-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-smr", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-ipp-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-rp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-rp-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-rp-1", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-ipp", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-ipp-0", "https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/vie-50098-002-eia"], "sectors": ["Transport"], "subsectors": ["Road transport (non-urban)"], "country_name": "\n", "timestamps": {"concept_clearance": "2016-11-29 00:00:00", "fact_finding_start": "2018-08-09 00:00:00", "fact_finding_end": "2018-08-15 00:00:00", "mrm": "2018-09-21 00:00:00", "approval": "2018-12-11 00:00:00", "last_pds_update": "2020-11-11 00:00:00"}}
